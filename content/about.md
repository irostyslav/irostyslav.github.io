Hi all, I’m a software engineer currently working on search infrastructure at Apple in Zurich. Before that, I was at Amazon’s Berlin office.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree from the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/) and a Master’s degree from the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/). During my studies, I developed a strong interest in algorithms, data structures, distributed systems, databases, and search engines. I explored these areas through my Master’s thesis on [graph compression](https://github.com/tomfran/ANS-Graph-compression) and through side projects, including implementations of an [LSM tree](https://github.com/tomfran/LSM-Tree) and a [search engine](https://github.com/tomfran/search-rs).

I had the chance to compete in [SWERC](https://swerc.eu/), a team-based competitive programming contest, in both 2020 and 2022. I also enjoyed participating in [Google Hash Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_Code_(programming_competition)) whenever I could.

Outside of work, I spend time practicing calisthenics and working on my cooking skills. I [read](/library) occasionally, though probably not as much as I should.
