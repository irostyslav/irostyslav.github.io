Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Ros is here. I am a product manager located in the Bay Area. For the last decade +, I've been a pm at companies like Amazon, Salesforce, Sephora, and others.  My focus: taking ideas from inception to scale, impacting millions. Here I share some of my learnings.


I hold an MS in Information Technology from [Odesa Polytechnic University](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%83%D0%BD%D1%96%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%82_%C2%AB%D0%9E%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%96%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D1%96%D0%BA%D0%B0%C2%BB). My career spans across SaaS and Cloud services, AI/ML and Data Analytics, eCommerce and MarTech/AdTech domains. 
At Amazon, my team was building a B2B Marketplace enabling a [bulk purchasing](https://business.amazon.com/en/solutions/bulk-buying) experience with the ease of a B2C customer.  At Salesforce, [Business Technology (BT)](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/case-studies/salesforce-business-technology.html) org, I've built SFDC CRM apps to streamline developer and admin operations, as well as workplace and employee experience.  At Sephora, I lead products pertaining to data infrastructure, ML, and advanced analytics, enabling marketing automation and omnichannel personalization.


Outside work, I balance with trekking, psychology, and judo.
