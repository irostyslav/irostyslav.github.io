      <title>To Grok or not to Grok</title>

      <description>Grok 4, a new LLM, boasts advanced reasoning, real-time search, and tool use, with a dual-model architecture (Standard and Heavy) and strong academic benchmark performance. However, its launch is marred by concerns over ideological bias (referencing its founder&amp;rsquo;s posts), a major antisemitic content moderation failure, and rapid jailbreak vulnerabilities, raising questions about its safety and neutrality despite ambitious future plans.</description>

      <title>PMs versus AI Agents</title>

      <description>Generative AI in product teams is limited by data access and isolation. The next wave is AI agents deeply integrated into core systems, acting as proactive, autonomous, goal-oriented, context-aware, and action-oriented digital teammates. This will transform product management by automating mundane tasks, freeing PMs to focus on true strategy, discovery, and leadership, amplifying their impact.</description>

      <title>Prompt Engineering: Dead?</title>

      <description>Manual prompt engineering is inefficient and dead. The future involves automated prompt optimization using a three-part system: a core LLM application, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator to measure performance, and an auto-improving agent that researches, generates, and refines prompts. This approach has shown significant performance gains, shifting the focus from manual prompt tweaking to building robust evaluators and agentic systems for continuous, automated LLM improvement</description>
